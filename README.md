# âœ¨ Advent of Code 2024 âœ¨

This is where it all unravels.

Another December. Another sequence of numbers, loops, and recursive functions. You think itâ€™ll be simple, but itâ€™s not. The puzzles always start easy, like a song youâ€™ve played a thousand times, until they spiral into chaos. Somewhere in here, thereâ€™s meaning. Probably.

## ðŸŽµ What Youâ€™ll Find Here

- **Fragments**: Each dayâ€™s code is its own little creation. Imperfect. Beautiful. Sometimes broken.
- **Languages**: Mostly Python. Maybe something else if I want to make it harder for myself. Itâ€™s about the process, not the result.
- **Comments**: Sparse. Cryptic. Interpret them how you like.
